DSA Cheatsheet I Wish I Had When I Was Preparing for Interviews

If you’re stuck solving random problems on LeetCode and still can’t recognize patterns — this is for you 👇

1 // Array Problems 
Ask these first:

➡️ Is the array sorted? 
– Yes → Think: Binary Search, Two Pointers, Prefix Sums 
– No → Look at intent of the problem.

➡️ Is it asking to optimize something? 
– Like max/min, number of ways, smallest value etc 
→ Use Dynamic Programming (if choices depend on previous state) 
→ Use Greedy (if each choice is independent & provably optimal) 

➡️ Involves removing or checking duplicates? 
→ Use Hash Maps, Hash Sets

➡️ Subarray/Substring-type behavior? 
→ Try Sliding Window, Prefix Sums, or Deque

➡️ Need to get frequent min/max or k-th element? 
→ Heap, Priority Queue, Monotonic Stack/Queue

2 // String Problems 

➡️ Manipulating characters, reversing, checking patterns? 
→ Use Two Pointers, Stack, or Hash Maps

➡️ Finding longest prefix, repeated patterns? 
→ Use KMP, Rolling Hash, or Trie

➡️ Need to track multiple substrings or palindromes? 
→ Consider DP, Center Expansion, or Manacher’s Algorithm

3 // Linked List Problems

➡️ Cycle Detection? 
→ Use Fast & Slow Pointers

➡️ Reversing a section or entire list? 
→ Use 3-pointers: prev, curr, next 

➡️ Tricky edge cases like head manipulation? 
→ Always try a dummy node

4 // Tree Problems (Binary or N-ary) 

➡️ Traversals? 
→ Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (DFS) or Level Order (BFS)

➡️ Need to compute something bottom-up like subtree sums or heights? 
→ Use Postorder DFS

➡️ Finding common ancestor, diameter, or depth-based logic? 
→ DFS with state tracking

5 // Graph Problems

➡️ Need shortest path or fewest steps? 
→ BFS for unweighted, Dijkstra for weighted

➡️ Cycle detection or topological sort? 
→ DFS, Kahn’s Algorithm, or Union-Find

➡️ Connected components or bipartite checks? 
→ BFS/DFS + coloring, Union-Find

➡️ Minimum Spanning Tree? 
→ Kruskal or Prim

6 // Dynamic Programming? 
Check 3 things:

✅ Can the problem be broken into subproblems? 
✅ Do the subproblems repeat? 
✅ Can you store results in an array or hash?

If yes → It’s probably a DP problem.

7 // Backtracking?

Use it when:

→ You’re building all combinations/permutations 
→ There’s a decision tree where every path must be explored 
→ Constraints like "only one of these must be chosen"

Most interview problems are just one of 4-5 base ideas, 
identify the pattern early, and your chances go up 10x.
