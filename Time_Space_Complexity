2. What Is Time Complexity?
Time complexity is the computational complexity describing the amount of time required for the execution of an algorithm. Time complexity measures the time taken by every statement of the algorithm. 
Hence, it highly depends on the size of processed data. Additionally, it helps to define the effectiveness of an algorithm and to evaluate its performance.

Because time complexity is an asymptotic function calculated from the size of input data, it takes as notation the mathematical symbols of Landau: \mathcal{O}, \Omega, and \Theta. Here, each symbol defines different time complexity.

\mathcal{O} notation represents an upper bound for the time needed, describing the worst-case scenario. The notation \Omega gives a lower bound for the time needed.
It describes the best-case scenario. \Theta notation frames the time needed by an upper bound and a lower bound. It narrates the average-case scenario.
