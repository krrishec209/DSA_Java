15 Leetcode articles I wish I'd read sooner.

This would have saved me from solving 1500+ problems:

Backtracking Patterns: https://lnkd.in/g9csxVa4

Sliding Window patterns: https://lnkd.in/gjatQ5pK

Sliding Windows on Strings Pattern: https://lnkd.in/gX8ebtnb

Two Pointers Patterns: https://lnkd.in/gBfWgHYe

Substring Problem Patterns: https://lnkd.in/gdGtE72g

Tree Patterns: https://lnkd.in/gKja_D5H

Tree Iterative Traversal: https://lnkd.in/gGpXjHt5

Dynamic Programming Patterns: https://lnkd.in/gbpRU46g

*****************************

I solved 900+ Leetcode Problems during my 2+ years of Grind in college, which eventually helped me land my current job at Google. 

If I had to start Leetcode all over again & focus on quality problems, this is how I would do it, I would go for pattern-based learning. 

► But before everything, I would create a small roadmap for myself, like this: https://lnkd.in/et8pva2U

► For DSA Patterns, I would learn from free resources here: 
– Backtracking Patterns: https://lnkd.in/g9csxVa4

► For the Best use of Leetcode, I would read this: https://lnkd.in/e7HcCNJ8

►I would also regularly read good articles from Leetcode like this: 
0. Topic wise problems for budding developers
https://lnkd.in/eG7275xr
1. Best List from Leetcode for technical interviews
https://lnkd.in/eVMEcXfx
2. Challenging Hard questions to build understanding of concepts

P.S: If you’re currently preparing for DSA, HLD, and LLD.

Check out my one-stop resource guide on Topmate:
→ https://lnkd.in/eYHSjbys ( 750+ students are already using it)

This guide will help you with:
- DSA, HLD, and LLD for interviews
- good resources that I used personally
- lots of problems and case studies for DSA and system design
