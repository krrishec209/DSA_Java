We spent 4+ hours to update our pattern recognition cheatsheet and help you solve 95% of all DSA problems in interviews (based on my mentee's interview experiences with Uber, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon...)

Most people think just knowing the DSA patterns will automatically help you recognize them but no, it takes skill to pick that up, so we thought why not make it easy for you? 

Here's what we made after great work with the team and my mentees: 

⥹Two Pointers
Use when: You’re working with a sorted array or string, and you need to compare or process elements from both ends at once.

Spot it: “Find pairs with sum X,” “reverse in place,” “remove duplicates,” “merge two sorted lists.”

How: Set left/right pointers, move them based on logic to avoid O(n²) brute force.

⥹ Binary Search

Use when: You need to find a target, boundary, or optimal value in a sorted array or answer 
Space.

Spot it: “Find element/threshold,” “first/last occurrence,” “minimum capacity to ship packages.”

How: Narrow search range by half each time, targeting O(log n).

—----
Most students struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic. 
But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong. 

Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck. 

That’s why I’ve put together this DSA Pattern Sheet, which helps you:

✅ identify key patterns and learn when to apply them.
✅ understand scenarios and clues that signal which approach to use.
✅ practice with 5-6 leetcode problems per pattern to solidify learning.
✅ cover 250-300 essential problems & master every core concept.

⥹ Hashing (Set/Map)

Use when: Fast lookups, uniqueness, frequency, or grouping is required.

Spot it: “Detect duplicates,” “group anagrams,” “find missing/extra element.”

How: Store elements/counts for O(1) access, turning nested loops into O(n).

⥹ Sliding Window

Use when: Problems ask for longest/shortest subarray or substring, usually with sums, counts, or unique values.

Spot it: “Longest substring without repeats,” “max sum subarray of size k,” “minimum window containing all chars.”

How: Adjust window size by moving left/right, keeping everything in O(n).

⥹ Stack/Queue

Use when: Order, pairing, or “next greater/smaller” matters; also for simulating processes.

Spot it: “Balance parentheses,” “evaluate expressions,” “next greater element,” “undo/redo.”

How: Use stack for LIFO, queue for FIFO; helps in traversing, tracking, and undoing.

⥹ Recursion

Use when: The problem or data structure is naturally defined in terms of itself (e.g., trees, combinations).

Spot it: “Tree traversal,” “divide and conquer,” “generate combinations/permutations.”

How: Function calls itself with reduced/altered input, often leading to cleaner code for nested/branching tasks.

Linked List

Use when: Need to manipulate nodes (insert, delete, reverse) efficiently, or when problem already gives you a list.
Spot it: “Reverse a linked list,” “detect cycle,” “remove nth node from end.”
How: Use pointers to change structure in-place; no array indices.

Graphs

Use when: Problems describe networks, connections, grids, or anything with “reach from A to B.”
Spot it: “Shortest path,” “islands,” “can you reach,” “friend circles.”
How: BFS/DFS for traversals, sometimes Dijkstra/Toposort for paths and dependencies.

Heap/Priority Queue
Use when: You need quick access to min/max, or want to always process highest/lowest value next.
Spot it: “Find Kth largest/smallest,” “running median,” “merge K sorted lists.”
How: Insert/delete in O(log n), peek at top in O(1); perfect for top-K problems.

Backtracking
Use when: All combinations/permutations/possibilities need to be explored, often in puzzles or constraint problems.
Spot it: “N-Queens,” “Sudoku,” “generate all subsets/combinations.”
How: Try, undo, and try next possibility; works for small input sizes.


Union Find (Disjoint Set)
Use when: Problems about groupings, merging sets, or checking if nodes are connected.
Spot it: “Number of islands,” “friend circles,” “detect cycle in undirected graph.”
How: Efficiently merge and find leaders with path compression, almost O(1).
