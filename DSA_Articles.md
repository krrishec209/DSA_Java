*****************

Cracking Leetcode problems fast during interviews = Knowing & recognizing the patterns.

That’s why DSA will always feel hard until you learn these 15 essential patterns:

1. Sliding Window

— Logic: Used for problems dealing with subarrays/substrings or “windows” of a fixed or variable size.

— Clue to find problems: Look for descriptions involving “subarray,” “contiguous,” “window size,” or questions about finding max/min/sum in a window.

— Keywords: subarray, window, consecutive, fixed size, substring, contiguous

2. Two Pointers

— Logic: Great for problems where you scan an array from both ends, remove duplicates, or partition/sort efficiently.

— Clue to find problems: Look for problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of the array.

— Keywords: sorted, left/right, opposite ends, pair sum, move pointers, partition

3. Prefix Sum

— Logic: Efficiently computes the sum of elements in a range, often in O(1) after preprocessing.

— Clue to find problems: Questions about cumulative sums, range queries, or “sum between indices.”

— Keywords: cumulative, sum, range sum, running total, precompute, difference

Before we continue, let me tell you that most people struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic. But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong.

Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview that you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck.

That’s why I’ve put together this DSA Pattern Sheet, which helps you:
✅ identify key patterns and learn when to apply them.
✅ understand scenarios and clues that signal which approach to use.
✅ practice with 5-6 leetcode problems per pattern to solidify learning.
✅ cover 250-300 essential problems, ensuring you master every core concept.
✅ customize the sheet to track progress and adapt it to your needs.
