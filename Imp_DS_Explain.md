𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 !

𝟭. 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁: A linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸: An ordered collection of elements with a Last In, First Out (LIFO) access policy. Elements are added and removed from the top.

𝟯. 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲: An ordered collection of elements with a First In, First Out (FIFO) access policy. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

𝟰. 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗽: A specialised tree-based data structure in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, ensuring optimal priority-based operations.

𝟱. 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with each node having zero or more child nodes.

𝟲. 𝗦𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲: A tree data structure that represents all the suffixes of a given string, enabling efficient substring search and manipulation.

𝟳. 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes, facilitating the representation of relationships between entities.

𝟴. 𝗥-𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲: A spatial data structure designed for indexing multidimensional information, particularly used in geographic information systems (GIS).

𝟵. 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗲𝘅 𝗕𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿: A data structure in computer graphics that efficiently stores vertex data, enhancing rendering performance.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁: A probabilistic data structure with multiple levels of linked lists, enabling efficient search operations by skipping elements at various levels.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅: A data structure that uses hash functions to map keys to locations, providing constant-time average complexity for retrieval operations.

𝟭𝟮. 𝗦𝗦𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 (𝗦𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲): A persistent, immutable data structure that stores key-value pairs in sorted order, facilitating efficient read and write operations.

𝟭𝟯. 𝗟𝗦𝗠 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲 (𝗟𝗼𝗴-𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲): A disk-based data structure optimised for write-intensive workloads, organising data into levels and efficiently merging sorted segments.

𝟭𝟰. 𝗕-𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

𝟭𝟱. 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅: A data structure that maps terms to documents where they appear, facilitating fast full-text searches.

𝟭𝟲. 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲: An abstract data type supporting insertion and retrieval of elements based on priority, often implemented using a heap data structure.
